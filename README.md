# BOXING FAN APP

The Boxing Fan App is a web application built using Ruby on Rails for the backend and React Redux for the frontend. 
The Boxing Fan App runs on ruby 2.6.1p33 (2019-01-30 revision 66950) [x86_64-linux]
This web application is for users who want to create fun and creative lists for fighters. For example, I want to create a list of all the favorite fighters I like. You can add fighters to your list by simply going to the Add New Fighters route and fill out the form and choose which list you would like that fighter to be associated with.
